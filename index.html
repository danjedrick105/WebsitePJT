             <h1>Did you know?</h1>
             <p>Digital drawing can be traced back 
             to the 1960s when artists began experimenting with 
                 computers to create art. <b>The term "digital art" was 
                 coined in the 1980s.</b> The world's first digital works of art have been made into a <b>transformed anti-aircraft system</b>
                 <b>The first digital drawing software was executed on the first Mac computers</b> 
                 <b>First digital art exhibition took place in 1968.</b> In the year 1968, the Institute of Contemporary Art welcomed visitors to the Cyber ‚ÄãSerendipity. Digital graphics were shown alongside drawing machines for the robot K-456 by Jean Tinguely and Nam June Paik.
                 <b>You can work as Medical Animator.</b> It may surprise you to learn that digital artists play a significant role in the medical profession. As a medical animator, you can graphically interpret knowledge and help medical students understand the inner workings of the human body.</p>
